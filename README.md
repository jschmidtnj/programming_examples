# programming_examples
These are examples of past programming experience.

So here you will find my best examples of working with Java, Python, and Android apps. For a complex Java app, take a look at the Java Restaurant manager. It is written with JFrame so it has a graphical user interface, and the app allows for orders to be made quickly.

For a complex Android app, see my Android Arduino controller app, which allows users to pick the light intensity and color of the rgb strip, and see incoming and outgoing messages in real time ().

For a MEAN-stack application, look at my MEAN stack repo: https://github.com/jschmidtnj/MEAN_Authentication_Application. This app is used for login and logout services, and the mongodb database stores a hashed password, the name of the user, and the email of the user. The site is also secure, so that people cannot break into a user's dashboard.

For a good Python application, that employs responsive deisgn and math to create an intuitive and highly-configurable graphical user interface, look no further than my most current project for the Baja SAE team: https://github.com/jschmidtnj/StevensBajaSAE. You can read all about the concept and how it works on the readme, and this is the project I am most proud of so far.

And finally, for a good list of past classwork projects and personal projects I completed in those classes, take a look at the APCompSciHS (https://github.com/jschmidtnj/programming_examples/tree/master/APCompSciHS) and CS115 (https://github.com/jschmidtnj/programming_examples/tree/master/CS115) folders. The projects listed show just a taste of what I learned in school about Java and Python. Most notably, take a look at the musicrecplus.py file in the CS115 folder (https://github.com/jschmidtnj/programming_examples/blob/master/CS115/musicrecplus.py), which employs python to create a smart music recommendation service.

For some of my past hackathon projects, take a look at my devpost, which shows the projects as a portfolio: https://devpost.com/jschmidtnj. 

**Bonus:** You can also take a look at my Arduino code for an obstacle avoidance robot, which is also in my hackathon experience linked above.
